# Epidemiology

## 1- EPIDEMIOLOGY
Epidemic: Excess of expectations
Pandemic: worldwide epidemic
Endemic: expected rate (constant rate)

### 1 - b Epidemic
* Explosion source outbreak: Single source at a single point of time
* Single source, over time
* New disease outbreak: always epidemic, unless there is a constant number
- Epidemiology is about rates:
We use numbers, that we represent as ratios.
RATE = Actual cases / potential cases
Rates are events per 100,000 persons
potential cases: needs to be representative of the * possible cases * (e.g. breast cancer: female over the age of 30. Leave out the people not at risk.
The real issue is the denominator.

## 2 - INCIDENCE & PREVALENCE
=> need to be on the same denominator
- Incidence
*Number of NEW events in a population
*Attack rate = special type of incidence rate [not all people, but some specific people. e.g. people who eat a dish in a restaurant. Highest attack rate is likely to be ]
*Acute conditions
Risk: risk to catch or acquire the disease
Metaphor = everyone who walks in the room are the new people we're interested in
- Prevalence: 
*ALL cases in a population
*Point vs. period prevalence [diff is measuring time frame = the longer the time, the higher the prevalence]
*Chronic conditions
Risk: risk to have the disease
Metaphor = everyone who walks in the room and who are already in the room (incl. back and forth)
=> If you already have the disease you cannot catch it anymore
e.g. Tracking Influenza across the USA = incidence
vs. Diabetes = prevalence
Morbidity: disease = incidence or prevalence
Mortality: death = incidence (onset of death = new dead)
- Relating incidence and prevalence
2 ways to recall relationship
*prevalence = incidence * duration => direction of relation: as incidence increases prevalence increases
*"prevalence pot" diagram:
Reservoir is the general population at risk => incident cases go to the "prevalence case" pot. Those in the "prevalence case" pot can either stay there, go back to the reservoir, or die.
- Numbers are not reality: they are measurement of reality. Every measurement is reality * error.

- "Number Needed to Treat" (NNT)
It's actually about "prevention".
How many to treat to prevent one case?
= inverse of incidence rate.

## 3 - Vital Statistics and Rates
Birth rate = live births / population
=> also includes men and women not in age to give birth. For this, we use:
Fertility Rate = Live births / woman aged 15 to 44
Mortality Rate = deaths / population
Infant Mortality Rate = infant deaths / live births:
    Neonatal + postneonatal
    Neonatal = pre-28 days
    Postneonatal = post-28 days
Adolescent pregnancy:
10% US teenagers (1 million) - number decreasing.
- 15 to 19: 33% have an unwanted pregnancy. 50% have the child, 20% spontaneous abortion, 30% elective abortion (number in decrease)
- 50% do not use contraception the first time!
Issues for the child: prematurity, neonatal deaths more common, lower IQ on average and higher delinquancy
Maternal Mortality Rate = maternal deaths / live births
Case Fatality Rate (CFR) = deaths / cases of disease
=> Deaths given disease
Proportionate Mortality Rate (PMR) = deaths from cause / all deaths
=> Deaths as % of all deaths
Crude Mortality Rate = deaths per population
Cause-specific mortality rate = deaths from a specific cause per pop

## 4 - Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL)
=> concept of years lost between age at death and 75.
Although highest number of death is heart disease, since the age at which it happens is high, the best way to minimise the YPLL is to decrease accidents
Survival:
Median Time until half of the specific population dies.
Same for Life expectancy = it's not the age at which we are expected to die, but rather the age reached by half the population
BUT this includes all births, and therefore the best way to increase life expectancy is to decrease neonatal death

## 5 - Types of preventions
- Primary, secondary, and tertiary
Primary = Never acquired. Stopping onset of disease
Secondary = Fixing problem. Preventing prevalence = screening
Tertiary = Make it easier for people to live with it. Quality of life.
e.g. Getting a patient to stop smoking.
- if smoking is seen as an addiction, it's secondary
- if smoking is seen as risk factor for disease, it's primary prevention

## 6 - Specific and adjusted rates
- Crude rates = for the whole reputation (e.g. number of people who died for a given year)
- Specific rate = for subgroup of pop (e.g. gender specific, age specific)
=> target health care and gives information of how the disease propagates
- Standardised / Adjusted rate = when comparing 2 populations
=> Removing the demographic differences when the populations are different AND the disease depends on the age (e.g. heart disease)
Can adjust for race, age, gender, income, .. We always want to use an age adjusted data.
e.g physicians have a higher suicidal rate. We could say that it's because it's a stressful job, or because they have access to medications to kill themselves. But actually they are also of higher socio-economique status, and there is already a higher suicidal rate in that population. When correcting for higher socio economic status, the rate is the same.

## 7 - Understanding Screening (test in the US?)
Screening in done to find how many people have a disease following a test
Screening = table with Screening Test Results (Positive/Negative) and Present/Absent
TP = True Positive: Present and Positive // TN = True Negative: Absent and Negative
FP = False Positive: Absent and Positive // FN = False Negative: Present and Negative
N: Sample Size
Screening Tests Rule: Trues on top, divide by everything.
- Sensitivity: Detecting disease.
Only look into the present column. TP / (TP+FN). 
Without screening test, 50%. Looking for 95% sensitivity at least.
- Specificities: Identifying the non-disease.

## 8 - Study design: Observational studies

2 types of research study designs:
* Observational studies
= only observation
* Experimental/Clinical trial studies
= Intervention to test a change, modifying people's behaviour.

### Observational studies
Sequence of possible studies: basic to advance
1. Case report.
	* N = 1. Patient past, and symptoms
    * First stop in knowledge progress
    * Pb: only 1 patient, don't know what is indosynchratic from the patient
2. Case series.
	* N > 1.
    * Not what is unique to one, but common to all.
    * But there is no external comparison
3. Cross-sectional/**prevalence** study
	* Who has and who doesn't have the disease
    * What factors are associated with them
    * **Prevalence**: common or rare?
    No incidence, no causality
4. Case control study
	* Compare people with or without disease
    * Look for associated factor
    * Retrospective studies
    * No prevalence (onlu selected people)
    * **Causality**: Facilitating agent
    * What is shared among people with the disease and what is different from the non-diseased people
5. Cohort study
	* Best data, but expensive
    * Instead of looking into the past, we look into real time
    * Prospective study
    * **Incidence rate**: watch disease develop
    * No prevalence: don't have those that already have it
    * **Causality**: yes
	* Incidence data only
    
Analytical techniques for **cohort studies**:

* Relative risk (RR):
  * how much more likely?
  * Incidence rate exposed/Incidence rate unexposed
  * Statistical significance
* Attributal risks (AR)
  * Incidence rate exposed - Incidence rate unexposed
  * how many more?
  * Clinical significance

Analytical techniques for **Case-control studies**
	
* Not incidence data
* Odds ratio: increased odds of getting disease with exposure vs non-exposure to a risk factor
	* AD/BC

## 9 - Study design: Clinical trial

### 9a. Phases of clinical trial

* Phase 0: animals
* Phase 1: Healthy volunteers (not vulnerable)
* Phase 2: Protocol & dose levels (~100 patients)
* Phase 3: Efficacy & side effects (~1,000 patients)
    
Last phase is a **post marketing survey** (US: FDA asks for 18 months later). Will take off the market if there are issues, or simply add some warnings (e.g. very serious side effects but very rare)

### Basic components
* **RCT**: Randomized controlled clinical trial
	* control group: 
    	* placebo (everything same but the drug)
    	* standard of care: old drug instead of nothing
    * random assignments.
    * patient doesn't know what s/he is getting
    
* **Double-blind RCT**: RCT plus
	* Neither researchers nor patient know who is in the controlled group.
    
* **Community trial**
Try in real world circumstances

* **Cross-over study**
No group is untreated
	* To assess subtle effects
    * All patients are treated but at different times
    * Especially interesting for chronic disease (HIV/AIDS)


## 10 - Study designs: Bias in research

### Definition

  * Bias: deviation from the truth
  * Reliability: consistency or precision
  * Validity: accuracy or hitting the target

### Types of bias

* Selection bias: people are not random
* Non-respondent bias: people who do not answer are very different from the ones that answer
* Measurement bias: methods of gathering
	* *Hawthorne effect*: observation itself changes the behaviour = need a control group
* Experimenter expectancy: expectation affects the outcome 
* Lead-time bias: confusion early detection with survival
	* => Don't use how long people live after diagnosis; use life expectancy
* Recall bias: patient cannot remember something
* Late recall: most severe cases are already gone
	* => Look at all the stages of the disease
* Confounding bias: factors are related to each other
	* => Do multiple studies; each study is confounding in different ways.
* Design bias: non-comparable control group
	* => Random assignment


**EPIDEMIOLOGY DONE => Statistics!**

# Statistics

## Probability statistics

* **Independent events**: combine events with multiplications:

		A*B

* **Mutually exclusive** (within a single trial): combine by addition: 
	
    	A+B

* **Non-mutually exclusive**: Need to remove the common events (correction factor). e.g. diabet and obese.
If we don't know what the common population is, we can say it is A*B, by considering they are independant events. 

		A+B-A*B
        
## Descriptive Statistics

Describe what you have, keeping the essentials with a summary using:

* central tendency
* variation

=> abstract

Much of the world is a central distribution (bell curve)

### Central tendency

3 M corporation:

* Mean: average
* Median: mid-point, 50th percentile
* Mode: most frequent value
    
In a normal distribution, these 3 values are the same.

* Skewed distributions: positive (tail is on the positive) or negative

Order of the stats values in negative skewed: mean < median < mode. Always follow the tail.

If mean > median = positive skew.

### Measure of variability

* Range:
	* highest to lowest
    * easy but 
    	* use of only 2 data points
        * regression towards the mean (extremes are likely to be less extreme the following time.)
    * => range is not a stable indicator

* Standard deviation

		Sum((x-mean(x))^2)/(n-1)

=> n-1 is due to the loss of degree of freedom when taking the mean

### Percentages of the normal curve

* **Symmetrical numbers**: equidistant above and below the mean.

	_In a normal distribution_:
	* within +/- standard deviation around the mean: 68%
    * within +/- 2*standard deviation around the mean: 95.5%
    * within +/- 3*standard deviation around the mean: 99.7%

* **Asymetrical numbers**: percentage of cases within a discreet area as defined by standard deviation units
	
    In a normal distribution:
	* between the mean and 1 standard deviation above the mean: 34%
	* between 1 and 2*standard deviation above the mean 13.5%
	* between 1 and 3*standard deviation above the mean .15%
    
*Total distribution should be 100%, but it adds as 99% due to roundings. It's just a help.*
