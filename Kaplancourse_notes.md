# Epidemiology

## 1- EPIDEMIOLOGY
Epidemic: Excess of expectations
Pandemic: worldwide epidemic
Endemic: expected rate (constant rate)

### 1 - b Epidemic
* Explosion source outbreak: Single source at a single point of time
* Single source, over time
* New disease outbreak: always epidemic, unless there is a constant number
- Epidemiology is about rates:
We use numbers, that we represent as ratios.
RATE = Actual cases / potential cases
Rates are events per 100,000 persons
potential cases: needs to be representative of the * possible cases * (e.g. breast cancer: female over the age of 30. Leave out the people not at risk.
The real issue is the denominator.

## 2 - INCIDENCE & PREVALENCE
=> need to be on the same denominator
- Incidence
*Number of NEW events in a population
*Attack rate = special type of incidence rate [not all people, but some specific people. e.g. people who eat a dish in a restaurant. Highest attack rate is likely to be ]
*Acute conditions
Risk: risk to catch or acquire the disease
Metaphor = everyone who walks in the room are the new people we're interested in
- Prevalence: 
*ALL cases in a population
*Point vs. period prevalence [diff is measuring time frame = the longer the time, the higher the prevalence]
*Chronic conditions
Risk: risk to have the disease
Metaphor = everyone who walks in the room and who are already in the room (incl. back and forth)
=> If you already have the disease you cannot catch it anymore
e.g. Tracking Influenza across the USA = incidence
vs. Diabetes = prevalence
Morbidity: disease = incidence or prevalence
Mortality: death = incidence (onset of death = new dead)
- Relating incidence and prevalence
2 ways to recall relationship
*prevalence = incidence * duration => direction of relation: as incidence increases prevalence increases
*"prevalence pot" diagram:
Reservoir is the general population at risk => incident cases go to the "prevalence case" pot. Those in the "prevalence case" pot can either stay there, go back to the reservoir, or die.
- Numbers are not reality: they are measurement of reality. Every measurement is reality * error.

- "Number Needed to Treat" (NNT)
It's actually about "prevention".
How many to treat to prevent one case?
= inverse of incidence rate.

## 3 - Vital Statistics and Rates
Birth rate = live births / population
=> also includes men and women not in age to give birth. For this, we use:
Fertility Rate = Live births / woman aged 15 to 44
Mortality Rate = deaths / population
Infant Mortality Rate = infant deaths / live births:
    Neonatal + postneonatal
    Neonatal = pre-28 days
    Postneonatal = post-28 days
Adolescent pregnancy:
10% US teenagers (1 million) - number decreasing.
- 15 to 19: 33% have an unwanted pregnancy. 50% have the child, 20% spontaneous abortion, 30% elective abortion (number in decrease)
- 50% do not use contraception the first time!
Issues for the child: prematurity, neonatal deaths more common, lower IQ on average and higher delinquancy
Maternal Mortality Rate = maternal deaths / live births
Case Fatality Rate (CFR) = deaths / cases of disease
=> Deaths given disease
Proportionate Mortality Rate (PMR) = deaths from cause / all deaths
=> Deaths as % of all deaths
Crude Mortality Rate = deaths per population
Cause-specific mortality rate = deaths from a specific cause per pop

## 4 - Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL)
=> concept of years lost between age at death and 75.
Although highest number of death is heart disease, since the age at which it happens is high, the best way to minimise the YPLL is to decrease accidents
Survival:
Median Time until half of the specific population dies.
Same for Life expectancy = it's not the age at which we are expected to die, but rather the age reached by half the population
BUT this includes all births, and therefore the best way to increase life expectancy is to decrease neonatal death

## 5 - Types of preventions
- Primary, secondary, and tertiary
Primary = Never acquired. Stopping onset of disease
Secondary = Fixing problem. Preventing prevalence = screening
Tertiary = Make it easier for people to live with it. Quality of life.
e.g. Getting a patient to stop smoking.
- if smoking is seen as an addiction, it's secondary
- if smoking is seen as risk factor for disease, it's primary prevention

## 6 - Specific and adjusted rates
- Crude rates = for the whole reputation (e.g. number of people who died for a given year)
- Specific rate = for subgroup of pop (e.g. gender specific, age specific)
=> target health care and gives information of how the disease propagates
- Standardised / Adjusted rate = when comparing 2 populations
=> Removing the demographic differences when the populations are different AND the disease depends on the age (e.g. heart disease)
Can adjust for race, age, gender, income, .. We always want to use an age adjusted data.
e.g physicians have a higher suicidal rate. We could say that it's because it's a stressful job, or because they have access to medications to kill themselves. But actually they are also of higher socio-economique status, and there is already a higher suicidal rate in that population. When correcting for higher socio economic status, the rate is the same.

## 7 - Understanding Screening (test in the US?)
Screening in done to find how many people have a disease following a test
Screening = table with Screening Test Results (Positive/Negative) and Present/Absent
TP = True Positive: Present and Positive // TN = True Negative: Absent and Negative
FP = False Positive: Absent and Positive // FN = False Negative: Present and Negative
N: Sample Size
Screening Tests Rule: Trues on top, divide by everything.
- Sensitivity: Detecting disease.
Only look into the present column. TP / (TP+FN). 
Without screening test, 50%. Looking for 95% sensitivity at least.
- Specificities: Identifying the non-disease.

## 8 - Study design: Observational studies

2 types of research study designs:
* Observational studies
= only observation
* Experimental/Clinical trial studies
= Intervention to test a change, modifying people's behaviour.

### Observational studies
Sequence of possible studies: basic to advance
1. Case report.
	* N = 1. Patient past, and symptoms
    * First stop in knowledge progress
    * Pb: only 1 patient, don't know what is indosynchratic from the patient
2. Case series.
	* N > 1.
    * Not what is unique to one, but common to all.
    * But there is no external comparison
3. Cross-sectional/**prevalence** study
	* Who has and who doesn't have the disease
    * What factors are associated with them
    * **Prevalence**: common or rare?
    No incidence, no causality
4. Case control study
	* Compare people with or without disease
    * Look for associated factor
    * Retrospective studies
    * No prevalence (onlu selected people)
    * **Causality**: Facilitating agent
    * What is shared among people with the disease and what is different from the non-diseased people
5. Cohort study
	* Best data, but expensive
    * Instead of looking into the past, we look into real time
    * Prospective study
    * **Incidence rate**: watch disease develop
    * No prevalence: don't have those that already have it
    * **Causality**: yes
	* Incidence data only
    
Analytical techniques for **cohort studies**:

* Relative risk (RR):
  * how much more likely?
  * Incidence rate exposed/Incidence rate unexposed
  * Statistical significance
* Attributal risks (AR)
  * Incidence rate exposed - Incidence rate unexposed
  * how many more?
  * Clinical significance

Analytical techniques for **Case-control studies**
	
* Not incidence data
* Odds ratio: increased odds of getting disease with exposure vs non-exposure to a risk factor
	* AD/BC

## 9 - Study design: Clinical trial

### 9a. Phases of clinical trial

* Phase 0: animals
* Phase 1: Healthy volunteers (not vulnerable)
* Phase 2: Protocol & dose levels (~100 patients)
* Phase 3: Efficacy & side effects (~1,000 patients)
    
Last phase is a **post marketing survey** (US: FDA asks for 18 months later). Will take off the market if there are issues, or simply add some warnings (e.g. very serious side effects but very rare)

### Basic components
* **RCT**: Randomized controlled clinical trial
	* control group: 
    	* placebo (everything same but the drug)
    	* standard of care: old drug instead of nothing
    * random assignments.
    * patient doesn't know what s/he is getting
    
* **Double-blind RCT**: RCT plus
	* Neither researchers nor patient know who is in the controlled group.
    
* **Community trial**
Try in real world circumstances

* **Cross-over study**
No group is untreated
	* To assess subtle effects
    * All patients are treated but at different times
    * Especially interesting for chronic disease (HIV/AIDS)


## 10 - Study designs: Bias in research

### Definition

  * Bias: deviation from the truth
  * Reliability: consistency or precision
  * Validity: accuracy or hitting the target

### Types of bias

* Selection bias: people are not random
* Non-respondent bias: people who do not answer are very different from the ones that answer
* Measurement bias: methods of gathering
	* *Hawthorne effect*: observation itself changes the behaviour = need a control group
* Experimenter expectancy: expectation affects the outcome 
* Lead-time bias: confusion early detection with survival
	* => Don't use how long people live after diagnosis; use life expectancy
* Recall bias: patient cannot remember something
* Late recall: most severe cases are already gone
	* => Look at all the stages of the disease
* Confounding bias: factors are related to each other
	* => Do multiple studies; each study is confounding in different ways.
* Design bias: non-comparable control group
	* => Random assignment


**EPIDEMIOLOGY DONE => Statistics!**

# Statistics

## Probability statistics

* **Independent events**: combine events with multiplications:

		A*B

* **Mutually exclusive** (within a single trial): combine by addition: 
	
    	A+B

* **Non-mutually exclusive**: Need to remove the common events (correction factor). e.g. diabet and obese.
If we don't know what the common population is, we can say it is A*B, by considering they are independant events. 

		A+B-A*B
        
## Descriptive Statistics

Describe what you have, keeping the essentials with a summary using:

* central tendency
* variation

=> abstract

Much of the world is a central distribution (bell curve)

### Central tendency

3 M corporation:

* Mean: average
* Median: mid-point, 50th percentile
* Mode: most frequent value
    
In a normal distribution, these 3 values are the same.

* Skewed distributions: positive (tail is on the positive) or negative

Order of the stats values in negative skewed: mean < median < mode. Always follow the tail.

If mean > median = positive skew.

### Measure of variability

* Range:
	* highest to lowest
    * easy but 
    	* use of only 2 data points
        * regression towards the mean (extremes are likely to be less extreme the following time.)
    * => range is not a stable indicator

* Standard deviation

		Sum((x-mean(x))^2)/(n-1)

=> n-1 is due to the loss of degree of freedom when taking the mean

### Percentages of the normal curve

* **Symmetrical numbers**: equidistant above and below the mean.

	_In a normal distribution_:
	* within +/- standard deviation around the mean: 68%
    * within +/- 2*standard deviation around the mean: 95.5%
    * within +/- 3*standard deviation around the mean: 99.7%

* **Asymetrical numbers**: percentage of cases within a discreet area as defined by standard deviation units
	
    In a normal distribution:
	* between the mean and 1 standard deviation above the mean: 34%
	* between 1 and 2*standard deviation above the mean 13.5%
	* between 1 and 3*standard deviation above the mean .15%
    
*Total distribution should be 100%, but it adds as 99% due to roundings. It's just a help.*

# Inferential statistics

**Descriptive stats**: Summarise or describe what we have

**Inferential stats**: Going beyond what we have, making projections of what is true in the rest of the world => knowing for some predicts for all.

=> Make generalisations based on science.

Start with data on a _sample_ = projects for all _population_

**Tools**: confidence intervals and p-value

## Confidence intervals

### Concept
The exact number that we have is not reality, but *around* reality. 

= Trade-off: precision for confidence. We use an interval where we think it is true: approximation.

Focus is not on the number from the data.

### Calculations

	Mean +/- Z(S/sqrt(N))

* S = standard deviation
* N = size sample - the only one we can change: lever to change error.
* SE = S/sqrtN: Standard error => better small, so N should be as large as possible and S small
* Z = Standard score: made up distribution (mean = 1 and S = 1)

The aim of the **standard score** is to facilitate understanding the numbers = >0 values are above the mean and S gives how far we are from the mean.

* 95% => Z: +/-1.98
* 99% => Z: +/-2.58

SE gives the error: how large is the confidence of the model in comparison to reality

Z: confidence = degree of certainty in CI

### Interpreting

Overlapping CI mean that we cannot say if two values are *significantly* different.

CI: a way to estimate reality for the entire population

## p-value

### Null hypothesis

*Null hypothesis* is the **opposite of what we are looking for** (e.g. the drug doesn't work) = differences between the two groups are due to random factors, chance, but not the drug.

* One tailed null hypothesis: only 1 way to disprove it
* Two tailed null hypothesis: 2 ways to disprove it

### Analysis:

Data => test => t, F, r, and chi2

We're interested in p-value: supports decision making.

* 1. Proposition
* 2. Get empirical data
* 3. Compare to decise.

2 p-values: one decided (threshold) before getting the data, and computed p-value from the data. 

Usually p less or equal to .05 (alpha criterion)
= it corresponds to 95% change of being right.

2 possible outcome: p is above or below the bar.
* below: reject null hypothesis. Error of Type 1, alpha error => the drug works, with Type 1 error of p: possibility that it does not work.
* above: do not reject null hypothese.  Error of Type 2, beta error. Don't get the Type 2 error from the p-value.

# Statistical tests

## Types of scales in stats

* Key in selecting the test is the type of data we have
	* Nominal / Categorical: different groups
    	(e.g. gender)
    * Ordinal: groups in sequence
    	(e.g. class ranks)
    * Interval: Exact differences among groups
    	(e.g. height) = you can get a mean and a standard deviation
    * Ratios: Interval + true zero point
    	(e.g. temperature in K)
        
## Basic statistical tests

* Pearson correlation
	* Interval: 2
    * Nominal: 0
    * Linear relationship
* Chi-square
	* Interval: 0
    * Nominal: 2
    * Any number of groups
* t-test
	* Interval: 1
    * Nominal: 1
    * 2 groups only
* One-way ANOVA
	* Interval: 1
    * Nominal: 1
    * 2 or more groups
* Matched pairs t-test
	* Interval: 1
    * Nominal: 1
    * 2 groups, linked data pairs, before and after 
* Repeated measures
	* Interval: 1
    * Nominal: 1
    * More than 2 groups, linked ANOVA data

* Choices:
	* Correlation: for interval data
    * Chi-square: for nominal data
    * t-test: for interval and nominal data combined
    
## Meta analysis

* Combining results of many studies
* Mathematical literature review
 => Solution to confounding bias
 
## Pearson correlation

* Ranges from -1 to +1
* Further from 0 is stronger correlation
* **Only** looks for a **linear relationship**
* Correlation does not mean causation

=> represent them on scatter plots

## t-test

* Comparing the means of **2** groups
* Matched pairs t-test
	* Before and after measures and linked data (e.g. test at the start and at the end of a course)
* Analysis of variance
	* One-way: compare means of many groups
    * Two-way: compares means of groups generated by two
    
## Chi-square

* Only nominal data
* Any number of groups in variables

# Ethics

Decisions criteria to know what to decide.

5 court cases

## Karen Ann Quinian court case
* Woman in a coma: should life support be terminated?
* Doctor doesn't know
* Father says to terminate life support

=> court decided: the father (who knows the person best) knows best = **substituted judgment**

BUT not next of kin!

## Brother Knox
If not possible to know the substituted judgment: Best interest standard

* Benefit > Burden: do it
* Benefit < Burden: don't do it
* Doctor gets to chose because he is as good as anybody else.. not because he knows better.
* Rational standard

## Infant Doe

* Best interest standards
* Can be overrulled by foregoing lifesaving surgery

## Roe v Wade

* Abortion lifesaving decision
* In the US: 
	* Woman gets to chose for what to do about her body in the first semester
    * 2nd and 3rd: no standard 

* The patient decides: doctor lays out the options

## Tarasoff Decision

* Duty to warn/ Duty to protect
* When warning, must not put the patient in danger either..

## Rules

### Rule1: Competent patients have the right to refuse medical treatment
Patients have to *consent* to medical treatment.

* patients have control over their bodies.
* Not exceptions:
	* Preserving life
    * "It's like suicide"
    * For the sake of 3rd parties
    * Professional ethics

### Rule2: Feeding tube is a medical treatment and can be withdrawn at the patient's request
	* Competent patient can refuse even life-saving food and water
    * Anorexia nevrosa are patient for which refusing food is part of the illness and therefore cannot be considered competent on that matter.


### Rule3: Assume that the patient is competent, unless clear behavioral evidence against.
	* suicide attempts
    * gross psychosis
    * cognitive capacity prevents communication

/!\ Patients ARE competent, unless proven otherwise. The competence is not a medical decision, but a legal decision. Doctors therefore must use their best judgement on deciding if a person is competent. Incompetence must be proven: so if unsure, they are competence.

### Rule4: Special rules apply with children

* Under 18 is incompetent
* Emancipated minor: 
	* 13 to 17 yo, 
    * living as adults
    * => treat them as adults
* Partial emancipation:
	* 15 to 17 can make decisions for self in 4 areas:
    	* STD treatment
        * Substance abuse treatment
        * Birth control
        * Prenatal care

Being married or in the army is considered as being emancipated, but not having children

### Rule5: Parents cannot withhold life or limb saving treatment from their children.

* But parents get to make all other decisions!
* Although you only need one permission.. no need for consensus

### Rule6: Avoid going to court: decision making should occur in clinical setting

### Rule7: When surrogates make decisions for a patient, they should use the following criteria in this order:
* Subjective standard (oral is enough)
* Substituted judgment (knows the patient best)
* Best interest standard (burden < benefits only)

### Rule8: If patient is incompetent, physician may rely on advance directives
* Oral is enough
* Living will: 
	* legal document
    * limitations: 
    	* only for end of life care
    	* document is very old
* Health power of attorney
	* Designate who makes medical decisions in case of incapacity of expressing will
    * for any medical decision
    
### Rule9: Cannot help a patient to die

### Rule10: The physician decide when the patient is dead

General rule: ECG flat for a day..
 
# Physician patient rules

Behaviour of physicians with patients. Rules about the rules in the US as a whole.

* **Rule 1**: Patient is number 1. Your patient's convenience goes before you.
* **Rule 2**: Always respond to te patient.
* **Rule 3**: Tell the patient everything, even if they do not ask = everything you know should be passed on as soon as physician knows. 
* **Rule 4**: Work on developing a good long-term relationship with the patient. Patients need to be treated completely, not just acute problems.
* **Rule 5**: Listen, reflect, encourage. Patients need to talk so physicians learn more from their life - concern, life, .. 
* **Rule 6**: Negotiate, rather than order
* **Rule 7**: Respond to new people/information.
	* Don't get carried away by momentum = be flexible.
* **Rule 8**: Always admit that you make a mistake
* **Rule 9**: (in the exam) Never pass-off. Deal with your patient. Don't do referral. 
* **Rule 10**: Express empathy, give control. "I'm so sorry, what do you think we should do"
